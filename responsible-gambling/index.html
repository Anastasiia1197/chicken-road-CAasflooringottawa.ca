        <h2>Recognizing Warning Signs Before Problems Arise</h2>
        
        <p>Early recognition of warning signs can prevent more serious problems. Common warning signs include:</p>
        
        <div class="table-wrapper">
            <table>
                <tr><th>Warning Sign</th><th>Description</th><th>Recommended Action</th></tr>
                <tr><td>Loss of Time Control</td><td>Playing longer than planned</td><td>Set a timer</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Budget Exceeding</td><td>Frequently exceeding set financial limits</td><td>Use deposit limit tools</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Neglecting Responsibilities</td><td>Ignoring work, school, or family due to gaming</td><td>Set priorities</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Lying About Gaming</td><td>Hiding the extent of gaming from loved ones</td><td>Seek support from others</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Chronic Debt</td><td>Regularly borrowing money for gaming</td><td>Seek professional help</td></tr>
            </table>

        <h2>Debunking Common Myths and Misconceptions About Gambling</h2>
        
        <p>Many gaming problems stem from false beliefs. Here we debunk the most common myths:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>‚ùå <strong>"I'll surely win if I play long enough"</strong> - Game outcomes are random and past results don't influence future ones</li>
            <li>‚ùå <strong>"There are foolproof winning strategies"</strong> - No strategy can guarantee long-term wins in random games</li>
            <li>‚ùå <strong>"I must win now because I've been losing for so long"</strong> - The "gambler's fallacy" - each round is independent of previous ones</li>
            <li>‚ùå <strong>"Gaming is a good way to solve debts"</strong> - Gaming is never a solution to financial problems</li>
            <li>‚ùå <strong>"Only professionals can have gaming problems"</strong> - Gaming problems can affect anyone regardless of experience</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Understanding these facts is the first step toward a responsible approach to gaming.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container-long">
        <hr class="title-line">
        <h2>Self-Assessment Tools to Keep Your Gaming Under Control</h2>
        
        <p>Regular self-assessment helps you keep gaming within safe limits. Ask yourself these questions:</p>
        
        <ol class="pink-circle-list">
            <li><p><strong>Financial Control</strong> - Am I only playing with money I can afford to lose?</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Time Perspective</strong> - Is gaming negatively affecting my work or personal life?</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Emotional Well-being</strong> - Am I playing to escape problems or negative emotions?</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Social Relationships</strong> - Am I hiding the extent of my gaming from family or friends?</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Behavior After Loss</strong> - Do I feel the need to bet immediately again to recover lost money?</p></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>If you answer "yes" to any of these questions, it may be time to reassess your gaming habits.</p>
