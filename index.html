        <h2 id="game-info">What is Chicken Road?</h2>
        <p>
            Chicken Road is a crossing-style betting game that has revolutionized online gaming in Canada. Unlike traditional casino games, Chicken Road offers a unique social gaming experience where players can see other players' bets and cashouts in real-time, creating a community atmosphere that is particularly appealing to Canadian players who enjoy shared gaming experiences.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Gameplay, Features, and Graphics</h3>
        <p>
            The basic mechanics of Chicken Road are elegantly simple yet strategically deep. Players place their bets before the round starts, then watch as the chicken begins crossing the road with a growing multiplier. The crucial decision comes when players must decide whether to cash out before the chicken gets hit by traffic. Each round has a randomly generated crash point where the multiplier resets to zero.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Sound, Controls, and User Experience</h3>
        <p>
            Chicken Road features smooth animations and vibrant graphics that bring the game to life. The audio design complements the visual experience with appropriate sound effects signaling important game events. Controls are intuitive and responsive, with auto-cashout options available for strategic players.
